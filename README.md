#Standard Deviation Example Project
###And Example of Go services with a React.js interface

This project was built with Docker (docker-compose, specifically) and usees a MySQL database to house standard deviations calculated form user input.  It is complete with server-side error handling, client-side validation, and some cursory examples of unit testing.

Future additions will likely include more extensive client-side unit testing and BDD-style tests in Ruby-Cucumber.
